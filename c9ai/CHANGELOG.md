- **Multi-Mode Support**: Manual @action, natural language, and hybrid approaches
- **Smart Action Generation**: AI suggests appropriate commands based on task description
- **Seamless Execution**: Natural language todos can be executed directly

#### üîÑ Advanced Model Switching
- **Local ‚Üî Cloud Routing**: Intelligent switching between local and cloud AI
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Local ‚Üí Cloud ‚Üí Manual command progression
- **Real-time Switching**: Change models mid-conversation without losing context
- **Performance Optimization**: Local models for speed, cloud for complexity

### üõ†Ô∏è New Commands

#### Model Management
```bash
models list                    # Show available and installed models
models install <model>         # Download and install local AI models  
models remove <model>          # Remove installed models to free space
models status                  # Show disk usage and model information
```

#### Enhanced Todo Commands
```bash
todos add "natural language"   # AI converts to structured actions
todos execute                  # Interactive execution of actionable todos
todos actions                  # Show all actionable todos with intents
```

#### Interactive Natural Language
```bash
c9ai> compile my research paper           # Converts to: @action: compile research.tex
c9ai> list documents in /path/directory   # Executes: ls -la "/path/directory"  
c9ai> open my budget spreadsheet          # Converts to: @action: open budget.xlsx
```

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Architecture Enhancements
- **Modular AI Backend**: Support for multiple local LLM providers
- **Async Model Loading**: Non-blocking model initialization
- **Configuration Persistence**: Model preferences saved across sessions
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for all failure scenarios

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Models loaded only when needed
- **Caching System**: Intelligent model and response caching
- **Pattern Recognition**: Fast local pattern matching before AI processing
- **Resource Management**: Efficient memory usage for large models

#### Developer Experience
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed interaction logs in `~/.c9ai/logs/`
- **Debug Support**: Optional debug output for troubleshooting
- **Extension Points**: Easy integration of new AI models and actions
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Customizable model selection and routing

### üìä Privacy & Security

#### Local Processing

- **Data Privacy**: User data never leaves local machine in local mode
- **Transparent Processing**: Always shows which model (local/cloud) is being used
- **User Control**: Full control over when to use local vs cloud processing

#### Intelligent Routing
- **Privacy-First Defaults**: Attempts local processing first when available
- **Explicit Consent**: Clear indication when routing to cloud APIs
- **Fallback Transparency**: User always knows processing location
- **Opt-in Cloud**: Cloud processing only with explicit model selection
